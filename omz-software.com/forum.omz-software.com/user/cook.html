					<p><p><a class="plugin-mentions-a" href="ccc.html">@ccc</a> <a class="plugin-mentions-a" href="phuket2.html">@phuket2</a> you had a lot going on here with this and I didn't see. Sorry! Ian's original post got me thinking about layout a lot, and I started on something as well. I really like how you can do a lot of auto layout in html with css or javascript and it's really useful. I think the same is possible for <code>UI</code>. So far I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>distribute horizontally (equal distribution) with padding is possible</li>
<li>distribute vertically (equal distribution) with padding is possible</li>
<li>adjust width/height/x/y by percent (rather than by points or pixels)</li>
</ul>
<p>Working on a grid distribution.</p>
<p>None of this is too hard or rocket science. Just a bunch of numbers. I'm sure anyone could do it...<br />
It's really different than what <a class="plugin-mentions-a" href="phuket2.html">@phuket2</a> has above though...!!</p>
<p>I don't know why I didn't think to do this before... I seem to use a kind of distribution for doing buttons at times, but having it in a module would be much easier. Will share once I've got kinks worked out...</p>
<p>With what I have already I could do <a class="plugin-mentions-a" href="phuket2.html">@phuket2</a> 's battleship grid without the headache! But I want to improve the functions to make it even more straightforward.</p>

For vertical alignment you have another term you can use:</p>

					<p><p>Didn't know about the <code>logger</code> module until I was reading <a href="https://github.com/omz/Pythonista-Issues/issues/116#issuecomment-234811614" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a> initiated by <a class="plugin-mentions-a" href="phuket2.html">@phuket2</a>. Thanks <a class="plugin-mentions-a" href="ccc.html">@ccc</a> for mentioning about the logging module.</p>
<p>I've made <code>logging_setup.py</code> just for ease of use. I'm just sharing it if anyone wants to.</p>
<h4>This has a few defaults:</h4>
<ul>
<li>prints to a file (.txt b/c Pythonista doesn't open .log by default)</li>
<li>Note: if used in different scripts, the 'name' arg is important for logging to different files.</li>
<li>mode is set to overwrite (you can set it with keyword arg)</li>
<li>format looks like this: &quot;DEBUG: this is a message.&quot; (can change with <code>fmt</code> keyword)</li>
</ul>
<h4>A few benefits:</h4>
<ul>
<li>can have the log file in a tab in the editor</li>
<li>can use the 'Find' in editor to search the log</li>
<li>no console take-over when running your script</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quick setup:</h4>
<pre><code>import logging
import logging_setup
log = logging_setup.logging_setup('my_log') #use a unique name
log.debug('a message for the log')
log.error('oh no.')
log.warning('oh no.')
log.critical('call 911... or omz')
log.info('well now it seems you have some mighty fine logging going on.')
logging.shutdown() #necessary at the end of the script running
</code></pre>
<p>I did test this with using it in a few different files at the same time. I didn't think it was going to work because of name spaces (ex: if you use <code>log</code> in two files and have imported one file into the other) - but it seems to work fine. One very important thing: if you do not use <code>logging.shutdown()</code> it will not work properly (seems that logs are carried over from before).</p>
<h4>Code:</h4>
