<p>I was wondering if there is any explanation on why it is no longer possible?<br />
I used Pythonista last year with my grade 11 programming course and got over a dozen apps published on the App Store. I have just started using it again with this years group and told them we will be doing the same thing. If there is anything I can do to help the process along, please let me know. We will not be starting to write the final apps until December.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

					<p><p>In January I was successful at getting several apps onto the App Store.<br />
I just went back to load another one and I am now getting a Code Signing Error.<br />
I cleared out all my certificates and reloaded everything to ensure something had not expired.<br />
I even loaded an app built completely in Xcode and it worked fine.<br />
When I try using the Pythonista template I get:</p>

					<p><p><a class="plugin-mentions-a" href="omz.html">@omz</a> Thanks so much for getting back to me.<br />
I will give it a try and see what happens.</p>
<p>By any chance do you have an update to the GitHub repo with the changes already made to the pylib and pylib_ext, so that I do not have to run the scrip and change anything?</p>
<p>Thanks again, Patrick</p>

					<p><p>I am trying to upload a Pythonista project to the Apple App Store.<br />
I have tried many, many time and keep getting code signing errors.<br />
I am using Xcode 8.2.1<br />
So this is what I have done:</p>
<p>Started with new Xcode Swift single view project, archived it and was able to submit it to the App Store. So my certificates are all working. I downloaded the Xcode template and then archived it. When I submit to Apple, it hangs on the code signing for a really long time and then comes back with this error:</p>
<p>ERROR ITMS-90035: &quot;Invalid Signature. Code object is not signed at all. Make sure you have signed your application with a distribution certificate, not an ad hoc certificate or a development certificate. Verify that the code signing settings in Xcode are correct at the target level (which override any values at the project level). Additionally, make sure the bundle you are uploading was built using a Release target in Xcode, not a Simulator target. If you are certain your code signing settings are correct, choose &quot;Clean All&quot; in Xcode, delete the &quot;build&quot; directory in the Finder, and rebuild your release target. For more information, please consult <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html</a>&quot;</p>
<p>The only thing I can figure out is that it seems to be trying to code sign the PythonistaKit.framework and does not seem to be able to. I can see &quot;PythonistaKit.framework (0 Entitlements), just before I validate it.</p>
<p>Wondering if anyone else is able to reproduce this error, or even better have a fix to the problem.<br />
Thanks</p>
