					<p><p>I wanted to try and make a small app to help with breathing exercises. I haven't done anything with animation/ui yet, so I was wondering if anyone could help me with a starting point. I want the animation to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a circle expand for x seconds</li>
<li>Pauze for y seconds</li>
<li>Have the circle contract in z seconds</li>
<li>Pauze for a seconds</li>
<li>Repeat for b minutes</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately it would be nice to have all the settings and duration configurable in the ui, but changing the values directly in the script is no problem.</p>
<p>I thought the analog clock example would be a good starting point, but when I understood that one and tried to figure out how to use that approach for this use case, I got the feeling that the updating step would become more complex than necessary.</p>
<p>What would be a good starting point for this?</p>

					<p><p>In the ios contacts, you can add extra dates, for things like anniveraries. I'd like to use them to add birthdays of children, since they really don't need their own contact entry. The problem is that these dates don't end up in the birthday calendar, so I thought I'd use pythonista to construct such a calendar. Now, maybe I overlooked it, but I couldn't find a way to get to those extra dates, did I miss something?</p>
<p>If it's not possible to access them, I'll put the dates in the notes field and parse them, but that wouldn't be as elegant.</p>

					<p><p>Also, think about e^x or e^-x or e^4 (without the brackets). For that you definitely need regular expressions.</p>
<pre><code class="python">import re

					<p><p>I guess you'd have to use regular expressions to preprocess the user input before you plot. You have to be careful how you do it though, because e^ should become exp and not e**.</p>
<p>A quick and dirty solution would be to print a line to tell the user to use ** instead of ^ etc.</p>

When I tried to pip install that I got a 'Failed import test. Check for dependencies' error. From comments on the forum it seemed as it would be trivial to install pylint, am I doing something wrong?</p>
