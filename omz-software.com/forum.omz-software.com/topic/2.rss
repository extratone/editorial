<p>Login via Twitter (optional, for new users)</p>

<li>
<p>A nicer URL ;)</p>

</ul>
<p>If you already have an account in the old forum, here's what you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I've imported all users (and posts), but you need to set a new password. Simply enter the email address you used for the old forum here: <a href="https://forum.omz-software.com/reset">→ Reset Password</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The old forum is still online for now, so that links continue to work. In the next couple of days, I will start redirecting the old topic pages to the imported ones in this forum.</p>

<li>
<p>I'm not sure yet if I'll redirect the RSS feeds as well, you might want to update your feed reader manually in any case (some apps don't support redirection properly).</p>

<p>If you see anything that looks weird, or if you have any problems with accessing your account, please let me know.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, spam has been a bit of an issue lately. I don't know yet how well NodeBB will work in that regard, but I've taken some precautionary measures. Signups require solving a <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html" rel="nofollow">reCAPTCHA</a>, and all posts are checked by <a href="http://akismet.com" rel="nofollow">Akismet</a> – I don't have experience with the latter, but I've heard good things about it.</p>

I don't know how hard this would be to do, but it'd be nice if links to old forum posts changed. For example in the topic <a href="https://forum.omz-software.com/topic/2031/videos">Videos</a> <a class="plugin-mentions-a" href="https://forum.omz-software.com/user/ccc">@ccc</a> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This exploration allows you to record video from the camera... <a href="http://omz-forums.appspot.com/pythonista/post/6438894778187776" rel="nofollow">http://omz-forums.appspot.com/pythonista/post/6438894778187776</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It'd be nice and provide a smoother user experience if that was automatically changed to :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This exploration allows you to record video from the camera... <a href="https://forum.omz-software.com/topic/2026/capturemedia">https://forum.omz-software.com/topic/2026/capturemedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because as of right now, if I click that, it takes me to the old forum. This could be a matter of having a program that changes the physical links, or it could be a matter of when the old site goes down, having each page redirect to the relevant page on the new forum.</p>

<p>That's what I plan to do. It has the benefit that links from elsewhere also continue to work.</p>

This drove me nuts about the old forum too.</p>
<p>You can click on the topic title to start at the first post, or on the link to the right to jump to the last post but doing that means you'll have to scroll up to see if there were posts made between your last visit and the last post in the thread. Frustrating.</p>

I cannot seem to reliably get those blocks to either select all, or scroll.   Scrolling scrolls the page, and selecting never wants to grab the whole section, even when dragging to the top, etc.</p>
<p>I suspect there may be a &quot;trick&quot; to this (similar to selecting text on iOS in general... i have found that some webpages trying to select selects a whole paragraph...l unless you zoom/pan such that the right side of the text is off screen, at which point long tap selects single words).</p>
<p>Also.... on some threads I have noticed a little red plus sign in the bottom right corner, which lets you reply while still keeping the conversation in view.... but others default to fullscreen replies.... odd!</p>
