When you write in Markdown, you'll see a basic inline *preview* of your markup right within the editor. You can always switch to a full HTML preview with a left swipe gesture. This is also where you find additional tools – a web browser for quick research, the Python console for scripting, and the full documentation about all of Editorial's features.\n\nWhat sets Editorial apart from other writing tools is that it has an extremely flexible **automation system**. You can build your own workflows with an easy-to-use **drag'n'drop** interface and Python scripts. In fact, all of the commands that you see in the \"wrench\" menu are built with the very same basic building blocks that you can use for your own commands. Tap the (>) button next to them to see how they were built, then make your own! Have a look at the *Help* tab in the accessory panel for more details.\n\n## Tips and Tricks\n\n*\tTap on the title of a document at the top to view its outline (Markdown headings), word count, and to rename it.\n*\tThe extended keyboard row with special characters can also be used to position the caret in the current line – just swipe left and right across it.\n*\tYou can tap and hold the keys that have a gray corner to access additional characters. You can also swipe up on such a key to insert the first alternative character (e.g. '\\' when you swipe up on the '\/' key).\n*\tThe \"lightning\" button on the keyboard gives you access to text snippets. A few are already there to get started, but you can of course add your own, and trigger them with custom abbreviations.\n*\tTap on the gray triangle in the top-lefthand corner to show the *bookmarks bar*. You can add shortcuts to frequently used documents there, but bookmarks can also trigger your favorite workflows.\n\n## Feedback\n\nI hope you enjoy using Editorial.

Tutorial","class":"WorkflowActionStoreVariable","parameters":{"name":"regEx","value":{"type":"advancedText","tokenRanges":{},"text":"# Regular Expression Tutorial\n\n**Regular Expression**: A regular expression (abbreviated regex or regexp) is a **sequence of characters that forms a search pattern,**.\n\n**Expression**: An expression is a **combination of symbols** that represent an idea.\n\n**Pattern**: A pattern is a **predictable sequence** of shapes, sounds, or textures.\n\n**Make Simple**: So, a regular expression is a combination of symbols that represent a predictable sequence of characters. In simpler terms, **a regular expression is a pattern**\n\n# Find a Name\n\nLet's take my name for example:\n\n**Tutorial Doctor**\n\nThe pattern my name follows is that I have some letter characters, followed by a space, followed by some more characters.\n\nAn expression that stands for **letter characters** is:\n\n`\\w` \n\nSince my first name has 8 characters, I can represent letter characters with 8 characters in it like this:\n\n`\\w{8}`\n\nA good way to remember this is that you are searching for a *word*, with 8 characters in it.\n\nSince my last name is not a word with 8 characters, it does not match this pattern.\n\nNow that we have an expression for a word with 8 characters, we need an expression for the space that follows that first word.\n\nYou express a **space** like this:\n\n`\\s`\n\nNow we can represent my first name along with the space after it like this:\n\n`\\w{8}\\s`\n\nAnd finally, we can represent the last name like this:\n\n`\\w{6}`\n\nThe whole expression that represnts the pattern my name follows is:\n\n\\w{8}\\s\\w{6}\n\nSo if we search an entire document for things that follow the pattern of:\n\n(A word with 8 characters in it, followed by a space, followed by a word with 6 characters in it)\n\nWe will be able to find my exact name. And if there are other instances that follow this pattern, those things will be found also.\n\nSelect the expression above and run the \"RegEx Tutorial\" workflow to see what it finds!\n\n# Find a Number\n\nI was born in 1986. \n\nTo express a number you type:\n\n\\d\n\nThis stands for **digit characters**. To find a number with 4 digits the pattern would be:\n\n\\d{4}\n\n**Select the expression  above a d run the \"RegEx Tutorial\" workflow to see what it finds!**\n\n# Find Numbers and Words\n\nWe can mix this up a bit! \n\nI was born August 28th.\nMy friend was born July 4th.\n\nHmm. We have some letters and 2 digits, a space, two digits and two more letters after that. However, if we were to search for the letters by the exact amount of characters they have, we would have a crazy long expression.\n\nSo, how do we search for words that have more than 0 characters, rather than by their exact amount of chracters??\n\nOne way we can do it is by selecting a range\n\n\\w{1,9} \n\nThis means words with 1-9 characters. The reason I chose 9 is because the month with the largest amount of letters has 9 letters.\n\nNow we need a space\n\n\\w{1,9}\\s\n\nThen we need from 1 to two digits (no month has more than two digits)\n\n\\w{1,9}\\s\\d{1,2}\n\nAnd then we need two more letters\n\n\\w{1,9}\\s\\d{1,2}\\w{1,2}\n\n**Select, Run and see!**\n\n# Sometimes things are long\n\nWhat if we have something like:\n\n1000RFYY90897898\n\nHow will we find something that has this complicated pattern?\n\nWell, instead of selecting a range of letters, we can just find sequences with more than 1 character\n\n\\w+\n\nThis means 1 or more characters\n\n\\d+\n\nOne or more digits\n\nOur pattern for the example is then:\n\n\\d+\\w+\\d+\n\n**Run it!**\n\n1000 RFYY 90897898\n\nThis would be done as:\n\n\\d+\\s\\w+\\s\\d+\n\n**Go ahead and give it a go!**\n\n# Find an email\n\nSometimes things will have special characters like @ signs as in:\n\n**tutorial@yahoo.com**\n\nA pattern that all emails form is that it has some text and maybe some special characters followed by an @ sign, followed by some more letters (google,yahoo,aol) followed by a period and then by three more letters.\n\nAs you did with numbers, you can select a range of letters also:\n\n\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w{3}\n\n**Test it!**\n\nThis is the basic way to get the email listed above, but emails can have a range of different characters:\n\n**joe3love@aol.com**\n\nJust as we selected a range of numbes, we can select a range of letters\n\n`[A-Z]`\n\nCapital letters between \"A\" and \"Z\"\n\n`[a,z]`\n\nLowecase letter between \"a\" and \"z\"\n\n`[0,9]` \n\nNumbers between 0 and 9\n\n# So what if you want to choose letters OR numbers?\n\nYou use the OR symbol\n\n`|`\n\nyou can select all lowercase letters between \"a-g\" OR all capital letters between \"F\" and \"H\"\n\n`[a-g]|[F-H]`\n\nEnclose them in parenthesis to group them together\n\n`([a-g]|[F-H])`\n\nFor more complicated combinations that could be email addresses, we could use:\n\n([0-9]|[A-Z]|[a-z])\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w{3}\n\n# Symbols\n\nyou can also search a set of symbols by enclosing them in brackets\n\nThe order in which you specify the symbols doesn't matter, just as long as they are consecutive.\n\nName:\n\nWhen\"\"\n\nhas-been\n\n\\w+[-`\":\"]\n\n**Select and Try!**\n\n# Whole sentence beginning with a word\n\nThe caret symbol\n\n`^`\n\nMeans \"begins with\"\n\n^you.+\n\nThis searches things that begin with \"you\"\"\n\nTry it.\n\n# There is more to this than meets the eyeballs.\n\nBut that is all for this first \"basic\" tutorial.\n\n\\w{2}\\s\\w{2}\n\n**Go ahead and try it!**\n\nhahahahaha\n\n<hr>\n\n# This is a Legend of other symbols you can use:\n\n\n`\\d`  Represents any number\n\n`\\D` Represents anything but a number \n\n`\\s`  Represents a space\n\n`\\S`  Represents anything but a space\n\n`\\w`  Any character\n\n`\\W`  Anything but a character\n\n`.`  Any character except for a line break\n\n`\\b`  Spaces that proceeds or follows a whole word\n\n`+ ` one or more of  the code that precedes it (in the following case, one or more character).\n\n`?`  0 or 1 repetitions of code that precedes it(comes before it)\n\n`*`  0 or more repetitions of the code that comes before it.\n\n`{n}`  number of code preceding it to find.

If any person doubt the truth of this position, I have only to request him to cast an eye on England, where the brewing capital is estimated at more than fifteen millions sterling; and the gross annual revenue, arising from this capital, at seven million five hundred thousand pounds sterling, including the hop, malt, and extract duties. Notwithstanding this enormous excise of 50 per cent. on the brewing capital, what immense fortunes have been made, and are daily making, in that country, as well as in Ireland and Scotland, by the intelligent and judicious practice of this more than useful art.\n\nParagraph with inline elements. Yet how much *stronger* inducements for similar establishments in this country, where we have no duty on the raw **materials**, or the extract; and where the `important` article of hops is raised in as high perfection as in any part of Europe, and often for one third of the price paid in England. But a *still more important consideration is the health and morals of our population*, which appears to be essentially connected with the progress of the brewing trade. **In proof of this assertion, I will beg leave to state a well known fact**; which is, that in proportion as the consumption of malt liquors have increased in our large towns and cities, in that proportion `has the health of our fellow citizens improved`, and epidemics and intermittents, become less frequent.\n\n### More paragraphs\nThe farmer and the merchant will alike find their account in encouraging and improving the produce of the brewery.\n\nThe same observation holds good as respects the country, where it is well known that those families that brew their own beer, and make a free use of it through the summer are, in general, all healthy, and preserve their colour; whilst their less fortunate neighbours, who do not use beer at all, are devoured by fevers and intermittents. These facts will be less doubted, when it is known that yest, properly administered, has been found singularly successful in the cure of fevers. This the practice of the Rev. Doctor Townsend, in England, places beyond all doubt, where he states, that in fifty fever cases that occurred in his own parish, (some of which were of the most malignant kind,) he only missed a cure in two or three, by administering yest. Having considered the produce of the brewery as it is connected with health, we may, with equal propriety, say it is not less so with morals.\n\n### Short paragraphs\nThe farmer can raise no crop that will pay him better than hops; as, under proper management, he may reasonably expect to clear, of a good year, one hundred dollars per acre. \n\nBarley will also prove a good crop, if proper attention be paid to seed, soil, and time of sowing.\n\nThe merchant will alike find his account in encouraging the brewery, from the many advantages derivable from an extensive export of its produce to the East and West Indies, South America, the Brazils.\n\n## Examples of lists\nSky, or water coolers, in general, are:\n\n-\tsquare vessels\n-\tof the best two inch pine plank\n-\tproperly jointed\n-\tfrom twenty to twenty-five feet square.\n\nBut particularly to Russia, where good beer is in great demand; large quantities are annually sent there from England, at a much higher rate, it may be presumed, than we could afford to supply them from this country.\n\n1.\tSince writing the Preface, I have been induced to make an addition to this little work, in order to increase its usefulness, by giving the French mode of tanning, as practised by the famous Mr. Seguine.\n\n\tOf such importance did the Academy of Arts and Sciences at Paris consider this improvement, that they thought it worth while to appoint a committee of their own members to go down to one of the provinces where this gentleman resides, and there, on the spot, superintend his operations, which they did with minute attention; and it is from the journal of their reports to the academy, that the different processes of tanning leather in this ingenious artist's way are here given:\n\n\t-\tBrewing without boiling.\n\t-\tBrewing strong beer.\n\t-\tA simple method of giving new beer.\n\t-\tA simple method of preventing beer bursting the bottle.\n\n2. \tThis single advantage alone so forcibly recommends its adoption, particularly in a country like ours, where capital is scarce, that further comment is unnecessary. I have also added the Bordeaux method of making and preparing claret wine for shipping, as practised in that city and its vicinity; which practice may possibly hereafter be successfully applied to the red wines of this country.\n3. \tAs that territory is now in our possession, and its soil and climate peculiarly favourable to the growth of the grape, which is indigenous there, may it not be an object well worth the attention of our government, to encourage and improve the growth of the wine in that section of the union; which wise measure would, probably, in a few years, supply our own consumption, and leave a considerable surplus for exportation. \n\nAll these considerations united seem forcibly to recommend giving the breweries of the United States every possible encouragement and extension. Here, it is but justice to state, that the brewers of New-York deserve much credit for the high improvement they have made in the quality of their malt liquors within a few years, which seem to justify the hope that they will continue these advances to excellence, until they realise the opinion of Combrune and others, that it is possible to produce a malt wine.\n\n## Examples of blockquotes\nA new and economical construction of vats for keeping beer, which, in this way, may be rendered fire proof, whilst at the same time possessing the temperature of the best cellars, although above ground.\n\n>The best plan of a well-constructed brewery I conceive to be that of a hollow, or oblong square.\n\nA description of the form and plan of a brewery, distribution of the vessels; the most judicious and convenient manner of placing them, with a view to economy, cleanliness, and effect.\n\n>The best plan of a well-constructed brewery I conceive to be that of a hollow, or oblong square, where all is enclosed by one or two gateways, (the latter the most complete,) parallel to each other. The first gateway, forming the brewery entrance, to pass through the dwelling house; the second, or corresponding gateway, to pass through the opposite side of the square, into an outer yard, well enclosed with walls and sheds, containing cooper's shop, &c. where all the empty casks might be securely preserved from the injury of wind and weather. \n\n>>The sides of these coolers are generally raised from eighteen inches to two feet; in Europe they are generally leaded on their inside, but this expense may be saved, if they are properly made at first.\n\n>This yard should be further sufficiently large to afford room for a hay reek, firewood, dung, &c. \n\nCleanliness being as essential in the brewery as in the dairy, it is of th greatest importance, never to lose sight of it in every part of the operations, and particularly in selecting the ground and soil to place a brewery on. \n\n## Code blocks\nThe situation to be preferred should be an elevated one, and the soil either sand or gravel.\n\n\tIt is of great importance in the preservation of\n\tbeer that the cellars be dry.\n\nPumping by a hand or a horse power is a poor substitute, as by this means (which we find too common in breweries) the washings of the cellars have time to become putrid.\n\t\n\tThis is a serious evil, and should in all cases,\n\tas much as possible, be avoided. It is true, there \n\tare times, when a choice of situation cannot be made; \n\tin that case, circumstances must be submitted to, \n\tand people do the best they can.\n\t\n\tThe cellars and coolers of the breweries in this \n\tcountry should have a northern aspect, and the\n\tcellars principally ventilated from east to west.\n\tThe windows on the south side of cellars should be\n\talways close shut in summer, and only occasionally\n\topened in winter; the floors of cellars should be\n\tpaved with either tile or brick, these being more\n\tsusceptible of being kept clean than either pavement\n\tor flags.\n\nCleanliness being as essential in the brewery as in the dairy, it is of th greatest importance, never to lose sight of it in every part of the operations, and particularly in selecting the ground and soil to place a brewery on.\n\n## Horizontal rule\nOf such importance did the Academy of Arts and Sciences at Paris consider this improvement, that they thought it worth while to appoint a committee of their own members to go down to one of the provinces where this gentleman resides, and there, on the spot, superintend his operations, which they did with minute attention; and it is from the journal of their reports to the academy, that the different processes of tanning leather in this ingenious artist's way are here given.\n\n---\n\nAll these considerations united seem forcibly to recommend giving the breweries of the United States every possible encouragement and extension.
