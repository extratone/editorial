### *Writing On The iPad: Text Automation with Editorial*

> I know it's far from the priority list, I'm sure, but I've been diving deep into iOS history recently and came across mention of Federico's first book, *Writing On The iPad: Text Automation with Editorial*. I noticed that it's been unpublished from the Apple Books store and was wondering if you guys might consider re-publishing it. from all the commentary I've come across from the time, it sounds like it was universally acknowledged as the definitive pioneer work on the subject.
